Welcome to my humble homepage!

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computing Science with a specialization at the University of Alberta and working towards transferring into the Honors program in Computing Science.

My research interests include applying machine learning in image processing and gaming challenges. Additionally, I am actively seeking internships for Summer 2024 in Software Development or Machine Learning Engineering, and am open to relocation across Canada, with flexibility for remote, on-site, or hybrid work formats.
